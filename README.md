## Executive Summary
An end-to-end data engineering pipeline that analyzes 26,368 historical disasters to optimize humanitarian relief allocation. By integrating EM-DAT disaster records with World Bank population data, we provide actionable insights for disaster risk management.

## Data Sources

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

https://public.emdat.be/

## Key Performance
Metric	Value	Insight

Data Match Rate	93.4%	ISO + Year merge methodology

Traditional Method Accuracy	91.1%	Rule-based classification

Best ML Model Accuracy	88.4%	Random Forest classifier

Disaster-Specific Improvement	+0.1%	Marginal gain over universal model

Processing Time	<5 minutes	Full pipeline execution

## Core Finding
Simple rule-based methods outperform ML for highly imbalanced disaster data (95% Low priority events), challenging the assumption that ML always provides superior classification.

## Priority Classification Criteria

Disaster priority is determined by:
1. **Human Impact:** Total casualties + injuries
2. **Economic Damage:** Estimated monetary loss
3. **Scale:** Population affected percentage
4. **Type:** Disaster category (storm, earthquake, flood)

**Thresholds:**
- **High Priority:** >100 casualties OR >$10M damage
- **Medium Priority:** 10-100 casualties
- **Low Priority:** <10 casualties

## Research Questions & Findings
**RQ1**: Data Integration Methodology
Question: What methodology achieves optimal data completeness when merging disaster and population data?
Finding: ISO + Year merge achieves 93.4% match rate (24,617 of 26,368 disasters). Unmatched 6.6% are pre-1960 events or non-standard country codes.

**Output**: data/outputs/RQ1_Fig1.pdf (Match rate visualization) |

**RQ2**: ML vs Traditional Methods
Question: Do ML models outperform traditional methods for disaster priority classification?
Finding: Traditional rule-based methods (91.1%) outperform ML (88.4%) due to extreme class imbalance (95% Low priority disasters).

**Output**: data/outputs/RQ2_Fig1.pdf (Model comparison) | RQ2_Table1.xlsx (Performance metrics)

**RQ3**: Feature Importance
Question: Which factors most strongly predict disaster impact?
Finding: Top 5 predictive features (Random Forest importance)

**Output**: data/outputs/RQ3_Fig1.pdf (Feature importance plot) |

**RQ4**: Disaster-Specific Models
Question: Should we use different models for different disaster types?
Finding: Disaster-specific models offer minimal improvement (+0.1%). Universal model (95.4% accuracy) is sufficient for operational deployment.

## Operational Insights
Top 3 Most Vulnerable Countries
(Based on risk score combining frequency, casualties, and population impact)

**Country A** - High storm frequency, dense population

**Country B** - Multiple disaster types, limited infrastructure

**Country C** - Earthquake-prone, rapid urbanization

**Seasonal Patterns**
**Winter**: 22% of disasters, highest casualty rates

**Summer**: 28% of disasters, most flood events

**Spring/Fall**: More moderate impact events

## Resource Allocation Recommendations
Pre-position supplies in high-risk regions identified

Focus on storm preparedness (most frequent high-impact events)

Use simple rule-based alerts for operational efficiency
